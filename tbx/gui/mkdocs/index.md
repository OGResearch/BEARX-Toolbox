The graphical user interface for the BEAR Toolbox allows you to estimate and run
a variety of vector autoregressive models (VARs) without needing to write your
own code.

Your first select the input data, the type of model to estimate, and the tasks
to execute. Then, the GUI will generate a Matlab script for you that can
run, viewed, and further edited.
